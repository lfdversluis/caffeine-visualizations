    LDBC Graphalytics: A Benchmark for Large-Scale Graph Analysis on Parallel and
    Distributed Platforms
  publication: 'PVLDB 9(13): 1317-1328 (2016)'
  type: journal
  releaseYear: 2016
  abstract: >
    In this paper we introduce LDBC Graphalytics, a new industrial-grade benchmark
    for graph analysis platforms. It consists of six deterministic algorithms, standard
    datasets, synthetic dataset generators, and reference output, that enable the
    objective comparison of graph analysis platforms. Its test harness produces deep
    metrics that quantify multiple kinds of system scalability, such as horizontal/vertical
    and weak/strong, and of robustness, such as failures and performance variability.
    The benchmark comes with open-source software for generating data and monitoring
    performance. We describe and analyze six implementations of the benchmark (three
    from the community, three from the industry), providing insights into the strengths
    and weaknesses of the platforms. Key to our contribution, vendors perform the
    tuning and benchmarking of their platforms.

    Granula: Toward Fine-grained Performance Analysis of Large-scale Graph Processing Platforms.
  publication: 'GRADES@SIGMOD/PODS 2017: 8:1-8:6'
  type: workshop
  releaseYear: 2017
  abstract: >
    Big Data processing has become an integral part of many applications that are vital to our industry, academic endeavors, and society at large. To cope with the data deluge, existing Big Data platforms require significant conceptual and engineering advances. In particular, Big Data platforms for large-scale graph processing require in-depth performance analysis to continue to support the broad applicability of linked data processing. However, in-depth performance analysis of such platforms remains challenging due to many factors, among which the inherent complexity of the platforms, the limited insight provided by coarse-grained "black-box" and inefficiency of fine-grained analysis, and the lack of reusability of results. In this work, we propose Granula, a performance analysis system for Big Data platforms that focuses on graph processing. Granula facilitates the complex, end-to-end processes of fine-grained performance modeling, monitoring, archiving, and visualization. It offers a comprehensive evaluation process that can be iteratively tuned to deliver more fine-grained performance information. We showcase with a prototype of Granula how it can provide meaningful insights into the operation of two large-scale graph processing platforms, Giraph and PowerGraph.

    Design and Experimental Evaluation of Distributed Heterogeneous Graph-Processing
    Systems
  publication: 'CCGrid 2016: 203-212'
  note: 20% acceptance ratio
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2016
  abstract: >
    Graph processing is increasingly used in a variety of domains, from engineering
    to logistics and from scientific computing to online gaming. To process graphs
    efficiently, GPU-enabled graph-processing systems such as TOTEM and Medusa exploit
    the GPU or the combined CPU+GPU capabilities of a single machine. Unlike scalable
    distributed CPU-based systems such as Pregel and GraphX, existing GPU-enabled
    systems are restricted to the resources of a single machine, including the limited
    amount of GPU memory, and thus cannot analyze the increasingly large-scale graphs
    we see in practice. To address this problem, we design and implement three families
    of distributed heterogeneous graph-processing systems that can use both the CPUs
    and GPUs of multiple machines. We further focus on graph partitioning, for which
    we compare existing graph-partitioning policies and a new policy specifically
    targeted at heterogeneity. We implement all our distributed heterogeneous systems
    based on the programming model of the single-machine TOTEM, to which we add (1)
    a new communication layer for CPUs and GPUs across multiple machines to support
    distributed graphs, and (2) a workload partitioning method that uses offline profiling
    to distribute the work on the CPUs and the GPUs. We conduct a comprehensive real-world
    performance evaluation for all three families. To ensure representative results,
    we select 3 typical algorithms and 5 datasets with different characteristics.
    Our results include algorithm run time, performance breakdown, scalability, graph
    partitioning time, and comparison with other graph-processing systems. They demonstrate
    the feasibility of distributed heterogeneous graph processing and show evidence
    of the high performance that can be achieved by combining CPUs and GPUs in a distributed
    environment.

    Mnemos: Self-Expressive Management of Business-Critical Workloads in Virtualized

  type: journal
  releaseYear: 2015
  abstract: >
    Virtualized datacenters are central to the digital economy, but require
    new self-aware and self-expressive techniques to address increasing scales, changing
    architectures, and dynamic workloads. We propose Mnemos, a resource management
    and scheduling architecture that uses resources efficiently and reduces the risk
    of low performance. For this, Mnemos employs portfolio scheduling and topology-aware
    virtual-resource management, gathers and uses state information, self-adapts to
    significant workload changes, and is able to analyze risks. We validate Mnemos
    using real-world traces of business-critical workloads.

    Socializing by Gaming: Revealing Social Relationships in Multiplayer Online Games
  publication: 'TKDD 10(2): 11:1-11:29 (2015)'
  type: journal
  releaseYear: 2015
  abstract: >
    Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs) like Defense of the Ancients and StarCraft
    II have attracted hundreds of millions of users who communicate, interact, and
    socialize with each other through gaming. In MOGs, rich social relationships emerge
    and can be used to improve gaming services such as match recommendation and game
    population retention, which are important for the user experience and the commercial
    value of the companies who run these MOGs. In this work, we focus on understanding
    social relationships in MOGs. We propose a graph model that is able to capture
    social relationships of a variety of types and strengths. We apply our model to
    real-world data collected from three MOGs that contain in total over 10 years
    of behavioral history for millions of players and matches. We compare social relationships
    in MOGs across different game genres and with regular online social networks like
    Facebook. Taking match recommendation as an example application of our model,
    we propose SAMRA, a Socially Aware Match Recommendation Algorithm that takes social
    relationships into account. We show that our model not only improves the precision
    of traditional link prediction approaches, but also potentially helps players
    enjoy games to a higher extent.

  abstract: >
    In this paper we present the scaling of BTWorld, our MapReduce-based approach
    to observing and analyzing the global BitTorrent network which we have been monitoring
    for the past 4 years. BTWorld currently provides a comprehensive and complex set
    of queries implemented in Pig Latin, with data dependencies between them, which
    translate to several MapReduce jobs that have a heavy-tailed distribution with
    respect to both execution time and input size characteristics. Processing BitTorrent
    data in excess of 1 TB with our BTWorld workflow required an in-depth analysis
    of the entire software stack and the design of a complete optimization cycle.
    We analyze our system from both theoretical and experimental perspectives and
    we show how we attained a 15 times larger scale of data processing than our previous
    results.

  abstract: >
    Cloud computing is an emerging commercial infrastructure paradigm that
    promises to eliminate the need for maintaining expensive computing facilities
    by companies and institutes alike. Through the use of virtualization and resource
    time-sharing, clouds serve with a single set of physical resources a large user
    base with different needs. Thus, clouds have the potential to provide to their
    owners the benefits of an economy of scale and, at the same time, become an alternative
    for scientists to clusters, grids, and parallel production environments. However,
    the current commercial clouds have been built to support web and small database
    workloads, which are very different from typical scientific computing workloads.
    Moreover, the use of virtualization and resource time-sharing may introduce significant
    performance penalties for the demanding scientific computing workloads. In this
    work we analyze the performance of cloud computing services for scientific computing
    workloads. We quantify the presence in real scientific computing workloads of
    Many-Task Computing (MTC) users, that is, of users who employ loosely coupled
    applications comprising many tasks to achieve their scientific goals. Then, we
    perform an empirical evaluation of the performance of four commercial cloud computing
    services including Amazon EC2, which is currently the largest commercial cloud.
    Last, we compare through trace-based simulation the performance characteristics
    and cost models of clouds and other scientific computing platforms, for general
    and MTC-based scientific computing workloads. Our results indicate that the current
    clouds need an order of magnitude in performance improvement to be useful to the
    scientific community, and show which improvements should be considered first to
    address this discrepancy between offer and demand.

  title: >
    On the characteristics of grid workflows.
  publication: 'CoreGRID Symposium at Euro-Par 2008'
  type: workshop
  releaseYear: 2008
  abstract: >
    Abstract Grid computing promises to enable a reliable and easy-to-use computational
    infrastructure for e-Science. To materialize this promise, Grids need to provide full
    automation from the experiment design to the final result. Often, this automation relies on the
    execution of workflows, that is, of jobs comprising many inter-related computing and data
    transfer tasks. While several Grid workflow execution tools already exist, not much is known
    about their workload. This lack of knowledge hampers the development of new workflow

    The OpenDC Vision: Towards Collaborative Datacenter Simulation and Exploration for Everybody.
  publication: 'ISPDC 2017 (invited paper)'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2017
  abstract: >
    In the new Digital Economy, massive computer systems, often grouped in datacenters, serve as factories ``producing''
    cloud services with massive consumption. However, to afford cloud services globally, we must address new research
    challenges in designing, operating, and using modern datacenters.
    We must also address challenges in educating and training the next generation of datacenter engineers.
    Addressing such challenges, in this work we present our vision on OpenDC: we envision the exploration of various
    datacenter concepts and technologies, using existing and new scientific methods, enabling new
    education practices and topics, and leading to the creation of new software and data artifacts.
    We present the datacenter concepts and technologies we are currently planning to explore using OpenDC.
    We identify the scientific methods we want to use,
    and explain our vision of education practices.
    We present the architecture and open-source program underlying the OpenDC software, and the format and open-access data we use for datacenter experiments.
    We conclude with an open invitation for the community to join our effort.

    An Experimental Performance Evaluation of Autoscaling Policies for Complex Workflows
  publication: 'ICPE 2017: 75--86 (Nominated for Best Paper Award)'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2017
  abstract: >
    Simplifying the task of resource management and scheduling for customers, while still delivering complex
    Quality-of-Service (QoS), is key to cloud computing. Many autoscaling policies have been proposed in the past
    decade to decide on behalf of cloud customers when and how to provision resources to a cloud application utilizing
    cloud elasticity features. However, in prior work, when a new policy is proposed, it is seldom compared to the
    state-of-the-art, and is often compared only to static provisioning using a predefined QoS target. This
    reduces the ability of cloud customers and of cloud operators to choose and deploy an autoscaling policy.
    In our work, we conduct an experimental performance evaluation of autoscaling policies, using as application model
    workflows, a commonly used formalism for automating resource management for applications with well-defined yet
    complex structure. We present a detailed comparative study of general state-of-the-art autoscaling policies,
    along with two new workflow-specific policies. To understand the performance differences between the 7 policies,
    we conduct various forms of pairwise and group comparisons. We report both individual and aggregated metrics.
    Our results highlight the trade-offs between the suggested policies, and thus enable a better understanding of
    the current state-of-the-art.

    Exploring HPC and Big Data Convergence: A Graph Processing Study on Intel Knights Landing
  publication: 'Cluster 2018 : IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    The question “Can big data and HPC infrastructure converge?” has important implications for many operators and clients of modern computing. However, answering it is challenging. The hardware is currently different, and fast evolving: big data uses machines with modest numbers of fat cores per socket, large caches, and much memory, whereas HPC uses machines with larger numbers of (thinner) cores, non-trivial NUMA architectures, and fast interconnects. In this work, we investigate the convergence of big data and HPC infrastructure for one of the most challenging application domains, the highly irregular graph processing. We contrast through a systematic, experimental study of over 300,000 core-hours the performance of a modern multicore, Intel Knights Landing (KNL) and of traditional big data hardware, in processing representative graph workloads using state-of-the-art graph analytics platforms. The experimental results indicate KNL is convergence-ready, performance-wise, but only after extensive and expert-level tuning of software and hardware parameters.

    Elasticity in Graph Analytics? A Benchmarking Framework for Elastic Graph Processing
  publication: 'Cluster 2018 : IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    Graphs are a natural fit for modeling concepts used in solving diverse problems in science, commerce, engineering, and governance. Responding to the diversity of graph data and algorithms, many parallel and distributed graph-processing systems exist. However, until now these platforms use a static model of deployment: they only run on a pre-defined set of machines. This raises many conceptual and pragmatic issues, including misfit with the highly dynamic nature of graph processing, and could lead to resource waste and high operational costs. In contrast, in this work we explore the benefits and drawbacks of the dynamic model of deployment. Building a three-layer benchmarking framework for assessing elasticity in graph analytics, we conduct an in-depth elasticity study of distributed graph processing. Our framework is composed of state-of-the-art workloads, autoscalers, and metrics, derived from the LDBC Graphalytics benchmark and SPEC RG Cloud Group’s elasticity metrics. We uncover the benefits and cost of elasticity in graph processing: while elasticity allows for fine-grained resource management, and does not degrade application performance, we find that graph workloads are sensitive to data migration while leasing or releasing resources. Moreover, we identify non-trivial interactions between scaling policies and graph workloads, which add an extra level of complexity to resource management and scheduling for graph processing.

    An Experimental Performance Evaluation of Autoscalers for Complex Workflows
  publication: "TOMPECS (Best Paper Nominations from ICPE'17, revised and extended versions). Accepted, in print."
  type: journal
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    Elasticity is one of the main features of cloud computing allowing customers to scale their resources based on
    the workload. Many autoscalers have been proposed in the past decade to decide on behalf of cloud customers
    when and how to provision resources to a cloud application based on the workload utilizing cloud elasticity
    features. However, in prior work, when a new policy is proposed, it is seldom compared to the state-of-the-art,
    and is often compared only to static provisioning using a predefined QoS target. This reduces the ability of
    cloud customers and of cloud operators to choose and deploy an autoscaling policy as there is seldom enough
    analysis on the performance of the autoscalers in different operating conditions and with different applications.
    In our work, we conduct an experimental performance evaluation of autoscaling policies, using as workflows, a
    commonly used formalism for automating resource management for applications with well-defined yet complex
    structures. We present a detailed comparative study of general state-of-the-art autoscaling policies, along with
    two new workflow-specific policies. To understand the performance differences between the seven policies,
    we conduct various experiments and compare their performance in both pairwise and group comparisons. We
    report both individual and aggregated metrics. As many workflows have deadline requirements on the tasks, we
    study the effect of autoscaling on workflow deadlines. Additionally, we look into the effect of autoscaling on
    the accounted and hourly-based charged costs, and evaluate performance variability caused by the autoscaler
    selection for each group of workflow sizes. Our results highlight the trade-offs between the suggested policies,
    how they can impact meeting the deadlines, and how they perform in different operating conditions, thus
    enabling a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art.

    The SPEC Cloud Group's Research Vision on FaaS and Serverless Architectures
  publication: 'Second International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC@Middleware 2017)'
  type: workshop
  releaseYear: 2017
  abstract: >
    Cloud computing enables an entire ecosystem of developing, composing,
    and providing IT services. An emerging class of cloud-based
    software architectures, serverless, focuses on providing software
    architects the ability to execute arbitrary functions with small overhead
    in server management, as Function-as-a-service (FaaS). However
    useful, serverless and FaaS suffer from a community problem
    that faces every emerging technology, which has indeed also hampered
    cloud computing a decade ago: lack of clear terminology,
    and scattered vision about the field. In this work, we address this
    community problem. We clarify the term serverless, by reducing it
    to cloud functions as programming units, and a model of executing
    simple and complex (e.g., workflows of) functions with operations
    managed primarily by the cloud provider. We propose a research
    vision, where 4 key directions (perspectives) present 17 technical
    opportunities and challenges.

    Massivizing Computer Systems: a Vision to Understand, Design, and Engineer Computer Ecosystems through and beyond
    Modern Distributed Systems
  publication: 'International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems 2018'
  type: journal
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    Our society is digital: industry, science, governance, and individuals depend,
    often transparently, on the inter-operation of large numbers of distributed
    computer systems. Although the society takes them almost for granted, these
    computer ecosystems are not available for all, may not be affordable for long,
    and raise numerous other research challenges. Inspired by these challenges and
    by our experience with distributed computer systems, we envision
    Massivizing Computer Systems, a domain of computer science focusing on
    understanding, controlling, and evolving successfully such ecosystems.
    Beyond establishing and growing a body of knowledge about computer
    ecosystems and their constituent systems, the community in this domain
    should also aim to educate many about design and engineering for this
    domain, and all people about its principles. This is a call to the entire
    community: there is much to discover and achieve.

    A Trace-Based Performance Study of Autoscaling Workloads of Workflows in Datacenters
  publication: 'International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing 2018'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    To improve customer experience, datacenter operators offer support for simplifying application and resource management. For example, running workloads of workflows on behalf of customers is desirable, but requires increasingly more sophisticated autoscaling policies, that is, policies that dynamically provision resources for the customer. Although selecting and tuning autoscaling policies is a challenging task for datacenter operators, so far relatively few studies investigate the performance of autoscaling for workloads of workflows. Complementing this previous knowledge, in this work we propose the first comprehensive performance study in the field. Using trace-based simulation, we compare state-of-the-art autoscaling policies across multiple application domains, workload arrival patterns (e.g., burstiness), and system utilization levels. We further investigate the interplay between autoscaling and regular allocation policies, and the operational cost of autoscaling. Our comprehensive quantitative study focuses on traditional performance metrics, time- and memory-related complexity metrics, and state-of-the-art elasticity metrics. Our main results give strong evidence about previously unreported operational behavior, for example, that autoscaling policies perform differently across application domains.

    A SPEC RG Cloud Group's Vision on the Performance Challenges of FaaS Cloud Architectures
  publication: 'ICPE 2018'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    As a key part of the serverless computing paradigm, Function-asa-Service (FaaS) platforms enable users to run arbitrary functions without being concerned about operational issues. However, there are several performance-related issues surrounding the state-of-the-art FaaS platforms that can deter widespread adoption of FaaS, including sizeable overheads, unreliable performance, and new forms of the cost-performance trade-off. In this work we, the SPEC RG Cloud Group, identify six performance-related challenges that arise specifically in this FaaS model, and present our roadmap to tackle these problems in the near future. This paper aims at motivating the community to solve these challenges together.

    A Performance Study of Big Data Workloads in Cloud Datacenters with Network Variability
  publication: 'HotCloudPerf 2018'
  type: workshop
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    Public cloud computing platforms are a cost-effective solution for individuals and organizations to deploy various types of workloads, ranging from scientific applications, business-critical workloads, e-governance to big data applications. Co-locating all such different types of workloads in a single datacenter leads not only to performance degradation, but also to large degrees of performance variability, which is the result of virtualization, resource sharing and congestion. Many studies have already assessed and characterized the degree of resource variability in public clouds. However, we are missing a clear picture on how resource variability impacts big data workloads. In this work, we take a step towards characterizing the behavior of big data workloads under network bandwidth variability. Emulating real-world clouds’ bandwidth distribution, we characterize the performance achieved by running real-world big data applications. We find that most big data workloads are slowed down under network variability scenarios, even those that are not network-bound. Moreover, the maximum average slowdown for the cloud setup with highest variability is 1.48 for CPU-bound workloads, and 1.79 for network-bound workloads.

    An Analysis of Workflow Formalisms for Workflows with Complex Non-Functional Requirements
  publication: 'HotCloudPerf 2018'
  type: workshop
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    Cloud and datacenter operators offer progressively more sophisticated service level agreements to customers. The Quality-of-Service guarantees by these operators have started to entail non-functional requirements customers have regarding their applications. At the same time, expressing applications as workflows in datacenters is increasingly more common. Currently, non-functional requirements (NFRs) can only be defined on entire workflows and cannot be changed at runtime, possibly wasting valuable resources. To move towards modifiable NFRs at the task level, there is a need for a formalism capable of expressing this. Existing formalisms do not support this level of granularity or are restricted to a subset of NFRs. In this work, we investigate the current support for NFRs in existing formalisms. Using a library containing workflows with and without NFRs, we inspect the capability of existing formalisms to express these requirements. Additionally, we create and evaluate five metrics to qualitatively and quantitatively compare each formalism. Our main findings are that although current formalisms do not support arbitrary NFRs per-task, the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) formalism is the most suitable to extend.

    Serverless is More: From PaaS to Present Cloud Computing
  publication: ' IEEE Internet Computing, Sep/Oct edition, 2018'
  type: book-part
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    In the late-1950s, leasing time on an IBM 704 cost hundreds of dollars per minute. Today, cloud computing, that is, using IT as a service, on-demand and pay-per-use, is a widely used computing paradigm that offers large economies of scale. Born from a need to make platform as a service (PaaS) more accessible, fine-grained, and affordable, serverless computing has garnered interest from both industry and academia. This article aims to give an understanding of these early days of serverless computing: what it is, where it comes from, what is the current status of serverless technology, and what are its main obstacles and opportunities.

    A Reference Architecture for Datacenter Scheduling: Extended Technical Report
  publication: 'International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis 2018 (SC18)'
  type: conference
  releaseYear: 2018
  abstract: >
    Datacenters act as cloud-infrastructure to stakeholders across industry, government, and academia. To meet growing demand yet operate efficiently, datacenter operators employ increasingly more sophisticated scheduling systems, mechanisms, and policies. Although many scheduling techniques already exist, relatively little research has gone into the abstraction of the scheduling process itself, hampering design, tuning, and comparison of existing techniques. In this work, we propose a reference architecture for datacenter schedulers. The architecture follows five design principles: components with clearly distinct responsibilities, grouping of related components where possible, separation of mechanism from policy, scheduling as complex workflow, and hierarchical multi-scheduler structure. To demonstrate the validity of the reference architecture, we map to it state-of-the-art datacenter schedulers. We find scheduler-stages are commonly underspecified in peer-reviewed publications. Through trace-based simulation and real-world experiments, we show underspecification of scheduler-stages can lead to significant variations in performance.
