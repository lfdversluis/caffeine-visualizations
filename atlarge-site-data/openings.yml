  profileTopic: >
    Modern research in computer systems seeks fundamental knowledge, inspired by real-world applications and aiming at societal impact. Our society increasingly produces and consumes data with unprecedented vicissitude: rate, scale, and complexity keep increasing. Consequently, large-scale data-management systems are an emerging and complex challenge for modern computer systems research.

  profileCandidate: >
    We are looking for a candidate who ideally has a strong international research profile in an area of data-management systems, broadly construed, and a strong track record in teaching computer science courses at university level. The candidate should be able to conduct core data-management systems research, for example, design, development, deployment, analysis, real-world experimentation, and benchmarking. Research could be inspired, among others, by applications in computer science (e.g., cloud computing, big data), and by user-facing applications (e.g., e-Science, business-critical applications, etc.).

  profileCandidatePlus: >
    The profile for the candidate includes bridging the gap between theory and practice, by collaborating with researchers in fields such as systems security, HPC systems, distributed algorithms, Web science, or data science. The profile requires the candidate to have a clear potential to acquire external funding and run research projects.

  profileCandidateSuccessful: >
    The successful candidate is expected to pursue a research-inspired teaching program, including teaching introductory and advanced classes at Bachelor and Master level, supervising undergraduate and graduate students, and performing management tasks within the department.

  reqGoals: >
    A successful candidate will set up a unique, world-class research programme, complemented by high-quality teaching and industry-engagement programmes. A criterion for success is the extent to which the candidate’s research programme stands out in uniqueness while at the same time linking to other research programmes at Vrije Unviersiteit and internationally.

  reqBackground: >
    Successful candidates will have a background in Computer Science. The ideal candidate can already demonstrate high-quality research credentials, and experience with education processes at both Bachelor and Master level. Significant criteria for demonstrating high quality include already obtained personal grants and research awards, and consistent presence in top-level conferences in relevant fields. We see supervision and development of young researchers as an important aspect of the ideal candidate. We encourage applicants who have already taken roles in creating and delivering courses at academic level. We consider a plus prior experience with attracting funds for projects involving industry and governance, with involvement in research projects that have resulted in demonstrable adoption of technology by industry.

  reqDiversity: >
    We are actively engaged in increasing diversity in computer science programmes and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is an equal-opportunity employer. We explicitly welcome applications from female candidates.

  reqSkills: >
    The candidate must be proficient in English, and must be prepared to take courses for qualification as university teacher.

  detailsInitialAppointment: >
    For tenure-track positions, the initial appointment will be for a period between four and five years. Based on performance indicators agreed at the start of the appointment, a tenure track position will lead to a tenured position in a period of maximally 5 years. In the fifth year of the appointment the tenure decision will be taken.<br/>

    You can find information about our excellent employment conditions at www.workingatvu.nl such as:<br/>
    Remuneration of 8,3% end-of-year bonus and 8% holiday allowance;<br/>
    Participation in a solid pension scheme (ABP);<br/>
    A minimum of 29 holidays in case of full-time employment;<br/>
    A generous commuting allowance (65%) based on public transport.<br/>

  detailsSalary: >

    The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel, and depending on experience, range from a minimum of € 3,475 gross per month (salary scale 11) up to a maximum of
    € 5,405 gross per month (salary scale 12) based on a full-time employment.
