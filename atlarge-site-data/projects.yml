  longDescription: >
    Building a scientific website is an art of its own. Not only there
    are no standard commercial packages to do so, the practice of presenting scientific
    work and the scientific work itself change over time. Our website project aims
    to provide a good platform and format to disseminate the results of our research,
    education, software, data, and other projects.

  shortDescription: Massivizing Datacenter Scheduling to Bring All Data Services to All People
  longDescription: >
    Datacenters are factories producing (hosting) data services for
    our Digital Economy. Like any factory, they need to be efficient, scalable, and
    effective. MagnaData will develop groundbreaking resource management and scheduling
    techniques for datacenters, which will help engineers manage increasingly larger
    datacenters, and address how social and sophisticated customers use data services.

  shortDescription: Benchmarking suite for graph-processing platforms
  longDescription: >
    The LDBC Graphalytics benchmark is an industrial-grade benchmark
    for graph analysis platforms such as Giraph and GraphX. It consists of six core
    algorithms, standard datasets, synthetic dataset generators, and reference outputs,
    enabling the objective comparison of graph analysis platforms. It has been adopted
    by the industry, who used it to benchmark products such as Oracle PGX, Intel GraphMat,
    and IBM OpenG. More details: <a href="http://ldbcouncil.org/ldbc-graphalytics">http://ldbcouncil.org/ldbc-graphalytics</href>

  shortDescription: Collaborative Datacenter Simulation and Exploration for Everybody
  longDescription: >
    OpenDC is a platform for collaborative datacenter simulation and
    exploration. Modern datacenters raise numerous research and engineering challenges
    in modeling, interfacing through APIs and programming languages, resource management
    and scheduling, giving performance and other non-functional guarantees, performance
    analysis, etc. Designing approaches that alleviate or resolve these challenges
    is made more difficult by the lack of analytical methods and by the complexity
    of testing in real-world environments (especially in production). OpenDC aims
    to alleviate these issues, by providing a high-quality, flexible, easy-to-use
    simulation framework for stakeholders from academia and industry.

    OpenCraft is a platform for research in massivizing Minecraft-like
    Networked Virtual Environments. It focuses on research questions such as: How
    to make such environments scalable? How to test the performance and scalability
    of such environments? How to add socially aware resource management and scheduling
    to such environments, and what is the benefit of it?'
